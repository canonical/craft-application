## Release cycle

<!---
The information under this header may not be strictly accurate for all applications.
Review the wording carefully and only copy it if the support offered makes sense. If it
seems wrong, speak with Canonical Security Engineering about refining a version for
your application.
-->

Each minor release of Craft Application used in a currently-supported version of a
Canonical product (e.g. Snapcraft, Charmcraft, Rockcraft) is supported.

Except for the above, only the most recent patch release of Craft Application is
supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

<!---
Replace the first link in this section with your repository's advisories board. See
GitHub's documentation for enabling the security advisory tab on a repository:
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
-->

To report a security issue, file a [Private Security Report] with a description of the
issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known,
mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy] contains more information about
what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
