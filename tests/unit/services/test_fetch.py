"""Unit tests for the FetchService.

Note that most of the fetch-service functionality is already tested either on:
- unit/test_fetch.py, for unit tests of the endpoint calls, or;
- integration/services/test_fetch.py, for full integration tests.

As such, this module mostly unit-tests error paths coming from wrong usage of
the FetchService class.
