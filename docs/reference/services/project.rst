``ProjectService``
==================

The ``ProjectService`` is a service for handling access to the project.

Project loading
---------------

The Project service handles loading, validating and rendering the project
file to a :py:class:`~craft_application.models.Project` model. The most common use
case is to render the project as though running on the host's architecture, for
the targeted platform. However, it can also  render a project as though it is
running on any architecture and building for any platform or architecture.

The rendering process follows these steps:

Configure the ProjectService
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is for the ``Application`` to configure the project service. It:

1. Set the project directory location. This is done by passing a directory on
   instantiation.
2. Set any ``platform`` and ``build_for`` hints. This is done using the
   ``configure()`` method.

Find the project file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a project directory is declared,
:py:meth:`ProjectService.resolve_project_file_path` finds the path to the
actual project file. By default, this is simply ``<app name>.yaml`` in the project
directory. However, applications may override this if they need to search for the
project file at other locations.

Parse the project file YAML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the project file is found, it is parsed as a `YAML`_ file. The file has additional
requirements beyond being a valid YAML document:

1. It must contain only a single document.
2. Its top level must be a map whose keys are strings.

Validate grammar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this step, any user-added grammar is validated using
:external+craft-grammar:doc:`Craft Grammar <index>`. No grammar is processed yet.

Perform application-specific transforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this step, any application-specific transformations of the document are applied
by the :py:meth:`ProjectService._app_preprocess_project` method. By default,
nothing happens here.

The project dict at this state is available using the
:py:meth:`ProjectService._preprocess` protected method. ``_preprocess()`` calls
``_app_preprocess_project()`` as the last step of processing before returning the
pre-processed project dict.

Expand the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, :external+craft-parts:func:`craft_parts.expand_environment` is called to replace
global parts variables with their expected values.

Process parts grammar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, grammar is processed for each part. This includes parts added
during the application-specific transforms step, meaning that transforms may add
grammar-aware syntax if needed.

Validate the Pydantic model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Pydantic model of the project is loaded, validating more thoroughly.

Check mandatory adoptable fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step in loading the project is checking mandatory adoptable fields. If
the ``adopt-info`` key is not set on the project, any mandatory fields that are
presented as optional because of their adoptability are checked to ensure they are
set.
