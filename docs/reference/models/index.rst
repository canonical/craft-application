Models
======

Craft Application uses `Pydantic`_ to describe the models used in project files.
This helps generate `JSON schemas`_ for the files, which facilitate editor integration.
The top-level ``Project`` model is nested with several other models.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   project
   platforms


.. _JSON schemas: https://json-schema.org/
