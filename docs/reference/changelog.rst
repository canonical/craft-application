2.7.0 (2024-May-08)
-------------------

Base naming convention
======================

Applications that use a non-default base naming convention must implement
``Project._providers_base()`` to translate application-specific base names into
a Craft Providers base.

The default base naming convention is ``<distribution>@<series>``. For example,
``ubuntu@24.04``, ``centos@7``, and ``almalinux@9``.

LifecycleCommand
================

Adds a new ``LifecycleCommand`` class that can be inherited for creating
application-specific lifecycle commands.

``_needs_project()``
====================

Adds a new command function ``_needs_project()`` that can be overridden by
subclasses. It's similar to the ``always_load_project`` class variable but takes
``parsed_args`` as a parameter. The default value is ``always_load_project``.
